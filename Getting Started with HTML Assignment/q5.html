    <h2>DOCTYPE declaration</h2>
    <p>doctype declaration in HTML is done at the very beginning or we can say that we start the file with 
        doctype declaration. It tells the browser what type of document to expect and here it is document type.
        It helps the browser to display web pages correctly, it must appear only once and it is not case
        sensitive.<br>eg: !doctype, !Doctype, !DocType, .. </p>
