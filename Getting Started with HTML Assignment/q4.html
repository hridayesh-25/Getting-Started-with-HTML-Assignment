    blocks and give instruction to browser how to display the content.<br> They are of two types:<br>
    <h4>1.paired tags:</h4>Tags which contain both an opening tag and closing tag. The opening tag starts with
     <q><</q> symbol followed by tag name and <q>></q>. The closing is similar to opening tag but also contains forward slash (/)
 at beginning. <br><h4>2.Singular tags:</h4>These tags contains only one tag which are used in the purpose where 
no content is used and don't have any closing counterpart.(example : image tag)</p>

    in between the tags. The start tag defines the beginning of a HTML element and end tag defines the end of a 
    HTML element.
